            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Registration is required to help us cover the costs of hosting you on the land and to ensure our teachers
            are paid well for their time and skills.
          </p>

          <h2>Friday Night</h2>
          <h3>Making Cordage from Nettles and Thistles</h3>
          <p>
            After supper you are invited to join us in the meadow for dessert where Tania will teach us how to harvest
            thistles. We will then bring our thistles back to camp where Tania will give us a demo on preparing nettle
            and thistles for cordage.

          <h2>Saturday Night</h2>
          <h3>Dolly Weave</h3>
          <p>
          There was a time when Tania would gather with her friends. Together, they would collect grasses and flowers from the meadow, weaving them into small dolls, shaping them after whatever was held quietly in their hearts. Afterwards, they would offer them to the fire — a small ceremony of release. Letting go of what no longer needed carrying, making space for something new.
          </p>
          <p>Tania is inviting us to join her in this tradition. To gather what the meadow offers, to shape it into something with our hands, to let go of what we do not need, and prepare ourselves for whatever might come next.</p>
