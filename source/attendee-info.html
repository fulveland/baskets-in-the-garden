            <h1>Attending Weaving Connections</h1>
            <p>Weaving Connections is happening this week! Please take a moment to read this page — you'll learn everything you need to know to have a safe and enjoyable time with us.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Arriving</h2>

            <h3>Address</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>7-52257 Range Road 231, Sherwood Park</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=7-52257%20Range%20Road%20231,%20Sherwood%20Park%20AB%20T8B%201A7,%20Canada&auid=8278686013468631948&ll=53.493168,-113.247714&lsp=9902&q=Aspen%20Ridge%20Greenhouses" target="_blank">Apple Maps</a>
              • <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XdmLeHtJb16Bbz8p7" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Parking</h3>
            <p>There will be parking in the main lot in front of the greenhouses, but not enough for all of us. If you are able-bodied, please park on the road east of the greenhouse gates.</p>
            <p>Here is <a href="/images/parking.png" target="_blank">the greenhouse map</a> which shows parking areas — and be prepared for mud!</p>

            <h3>Upon Arrival</h3>
            <p>Enter through the main doors of the greenhouse. The first room is called the "Header House". Restrooms are to the right, and the kitchen is straight ahead.</p>
            <p>The Header House is where we'll all meet up initially. There will be a table with name tags, and maps of the greenhouses & workshop locations. The Header House is also where we'll come together to enjoy our meals.</p>

            <h2>The Greenhouse</h2>
            <p>We will be weaving in a working, operational greenhouse that is just entering its busiest time of the year. The staff have done their best to make plenty of room for all the willow and weavers this weekend. However, some greenhouses still contain plants, and staff may be working around us on Friday. Feel free to look around, but please be respectful of the work being done to keep the greenhouse running.</p>

            <h3>Animals</h3>
            <p>There are three dogs and two cats on the property, all of whom are very friendly. The small black & white border collie is old, deaf, and blind, so she can be a bit nervous around new people. Please be gentle with her and avoid reaching out too quickly, as she may not see you and could get scared.</p>

            <h3>What to Wear</h3>
            <p>
              The temperature in the greenhouse reflects the weather outside. It can be sunny and warm, or quite chilly.
              <b>Bring appropriate clothing:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Warm: short sleeve shirt • summer shoes or sandals • sunscreen • hat</li>
              <li>Cold: a warm sweater • winter jacket • winter or mud boots</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Meals</h2>
            <p>If you have purchased meals, please <b>bring your own plate, bowl, mug and utensils</b>. We want to create no waste, like a hike: take out what you bring, leave no trace.</p>
            <p>If you are bringing a bag lunch, please <b>bring ice</b>. We do have access to a small fridge, but space is limited, and we cannot guarantee there will be room.</p>
            <p>The microwave is on the same breaker as our caterer's hot plates. We ask that you wait until 1:15 or 6:15 to heat your meals unless Elvira gives us the go-ahead to use the microwave earlier.</p>
            <p>
              There will be a community snack station! We encourage you to
              <b>bring snacks, tea, coffee, and anything else</b> that'd make you happy to share with the community — except alcohol. This is a dry event.
            </p>
            <p>There is a small kitchen available for everyone to use, equipped with a sink, microwave, and kettle. The tap water is safe to drink (it's city water).</p>

            <h2>Activities</h2>

            <h3>Open Weave</h3>
            <p>
              Bring your own project to work on, or join in on weaving our <i>forest friend</i>. If you have never woven a willow sculpture before, here are some YouTube videos to get your creative juices flowing: <a href="https://youtu.be/w_oAG3xyX2s?si=Tmz2Mb1r-0AempsR">Willow Sculpture Timelapse</a> •
              <a href="https://youtu.be/gXXlF_c5qEs?si=z_uFFwvRbuExYuJ4">Weaving Willow Sheep</a>
            </p>

            <p>We will have a limited number of chairs available in the open weave area. If you have one you'd like to use for yourself, or one you wouldn't mind sharing, <b>bring a chair</b>.</p>

            <p>Finally, if you have any to spare, <b>bring an armful of willow to share.</b> We need all the willow we can get.</p>

            <h3>Sharing your Weaving Adventures</h3>
            <p>Have you been busy weaving? We have many new weavers joining us this year! Bring some of your work to show off and inspire your fellow weavers.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to exchange one of your pieces, place it on the table at the Give and Receive Station — then choose another to take home in return.</p>

            <h3>Tools for Sale</h3>
            <p>At designated times throughout the weekend, we will have a small selection of basketry tools and books for sale. You can make payment through CC, cash, or e-transfer. If you have basketry-related books, tools, or materials you would like to sell, you are welcome to sell them in the main greenhouse at this time.</p>
