      <h1>Attending Baskets in the Garden</h1>
      <p>Baskets in the Garden is happening this week! Please take a moment to read this page — you'll learn everything you need to know to have a safe and enjoyable time with us.</p>

      <h2>Arriving</h2>

      <h3>Address</h3>
      <p><strong>20129 Township Rd 504, Tofield, AB T0B 4J2</strong></p>
      <p>• <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/X9mEaTN15sKdtNPfA" target="_blank">Google Maps</a></p>

      <h3>Parking</h3>
      <p>Pull into the driveway until you see Tania's house. To the right of the house is the shop. You can park in front of the shop. Tents, RVs, and car campers can go in the space between the house and the shop.</p>

      <h3>Animals</h3>
      <p>There is a tiny dog, "Sunny," that lives in the house.</p>

      <h3>Bathrooms</h3>
      <p>We will have two porta-potties and a hand-wash station set up behind the house.</p>

      <h3>What to Bring</h3>
      <p>Your favourite camp chair and maybe a blanket and pillow if you’d like to work on the grass in the garden.</p>

      <h3>What to Wear</h3>
      <p>We are at the beginning of sweater weather! Hot days and cool nights. We will be sheltered under a tent for most of the day, but it may still be a good idea to bring a rain jacket if it decides to sprinkle. Solid footwear is recommended for our walks to the meadow.</p>
      <b>Bring appropriate clothing:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Warm: short sleeve shirt • summer shoes or sandals • sunscreen • hat</li>
        <li>Cold: a warm sweater • fall jacket • warm boots</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Children</h3>
      <p>Children are welcome, but please note this is a working farm with many potential hazards. Parents are responsible for supervising their children at all times.</p>

      <h2>Meals</h2>
      <p>If you are coming for the day, please bring a bag lunch, snacks, and plenty of water. We will have tea and coffee on hand.</p>

      <h3>Potluck</h3>
      <p>Please <b>bring your own plate, bowl, mug, and utensils</b>. We want to create no waste — like a hike: take out what you bring, leave no trace.</p>
      <p>We will set crockpots up in the house. Small electric coolers can be set up in the shop.</p>
      <p>
        There will be a community snack station! We encourage you to
        <b>bring snacks, tea, coffee, and anything else</b> you’d be happy to share with the community.
      </p>
      <p>We’ll have a fire pit to cook on, a food prep area, and a dishwashing station set up for use.</p>

      <h2>Activities</h2>

      <h3>Open Weave</h3>
      <p>Bring your own project and join us in our weaving adventures! Tania has set up a table near the fire pit, or come join us in the big white tent.</p>

      <h3>Earth Loom</h3>
      <p>The Earth Loom is available at all hours. You are encouraged to collect grasses and flowers from the meadow and add them to our collective tapestry.</p>

      <h3>Sharing Your Weaving Adventures</h3>
      <p>Have you been busy weaving? We have many new weavers joining us this year! Bring some of your work to show and inspire your fellow weavers.</p>

      <h3>Tools for Sale</h3>
      <p>At designated times throughout the weekend, we will have a small selection of basketry tools for sale. You can pay with cash or e-transfer. If you have basketry-related books, tools, or materials to sell, you are welcome to do so during this time.</p>
