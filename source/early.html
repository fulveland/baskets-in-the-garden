        <h1>Cattail Cubby</h1>
        <img src="images/tania.jpg" />
        <div>
          <h2>Friday<br />9am - 6pm</h2>
          <p>Join Tania Kristensen in weaving this Cattail Cubby inspired by the traditional Scottish Caisie, once used for gathering and carrying, this basket is reimagined in a lighter form, perfect for hanging on the wall. Whether you use it as a kitchen caddy for holding garlic, onions, or herbs, or simply as a place for dried flowers or small treasures, it brings a touch of handmade warmth to any space.</p>

        <h1>Large Willow Basket</h1>
        <img src="images/freyja.jpg" />
        <div>
          <h2>Saturday & Sunday<br />9am - 6pm</h2>
          <p>Join Freyja Ulveland for two full days of weaving as she guides you through the making of a beautiful, sculptural willow basket. This project is big, bold, and deeply satisfying to create — a basket that shows off the natural strength and beauty of willow. Together, we will work with generous bundles of material to shape a basket with a striking twisted rope effect.</p>
          <p>Along the way, you will learn foundational techniques such as paring, waling, and rod borders, with the option to add a sturdy handle if you choose.</p>
          <p>The price of this workshop reflects the quantity and quality of willow required to achieve this larger, more ambitious form.</p>
          <p>Please note: colors of willow will vary and cannot be guaranteed.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Saturday<br />9am - 6pm</h2>
          <p>Join Tania for a relaxed and playful day of basket making. In this workshop, you will learn the art of coiled basketry using a mix of natural and reclaimed materials to create a basket that is uniquely your own.</p>
          <p>You are invited to bring along a small personal item to incorporate into your basket: a stone or shell from your travels, a feather, a scrap of cloth, or even a photograph. These treasured pieces will become part of the structure, adding meaning and memory to the form.</p>
          <p>Whether you are new to weaving or have some experience, this is a beautiful way to explore texture, storytelling, and personal expression through basketry.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Sunday<br />9am - 1pm</h2>
          <p>Slow down and savour the beauty of the small things with Kelsey as she guides you through this gentle Weaving Intentions - Mini Basket Workshop.</p>
          <p>In this hands-on mini basket workshop, you’ll learn how to weave a small basket using natural and ethically foraged materials like dandelions, grasses, bark, and other local fibres. As you work with these raw elements, you’ll also be guided through a simple but powerful intention-setting practice—writing a message, affirmation, or prayer to place inside your basket.</p>
          <p>Each basket becomes a reflection of your own story, decorated with symbolic colours, threads, and wildflowers that hold personal meaning. You’ll also learn the deeper symbolism behind the plants and materials we use, adding a layer of understanding and connection to your creation.</p>
          <p>If you wish, your finished basket can become a medicine pouch, perfect for holding sacred herbs, small items, or your intention.</p>

          <h1>Friday Night</h1>
          <h2>Making Cordage from Nettles and Thistles</h2>
          <p>After supper you are invited to join us in the meadow for dessert where Tania will teach us how to harvest thistles and nettles. We will then bring our harvest back to camp where Tania will give us a demo on preparing our nettles and thistles for cordage.</p>

          <h1>Saturday Night</h1>
          <h2>Dolly Weave</h2>
          <p>There was a time when Tania would gather with her friends. Together, they would collect grasses and flowers from the meadow, weaving them into small dolls, shaping them after whatever was held quietly in their hearts. Afterwards, they would offer them to the fire — a small ceremony of release. Letting go of what no longer needed carrying, making space for something new.</p>
          <p>Tania is inviting us to join her in this tradition. To gather what the meadow offers, to shape it into something with our hands, to let go of what we do not need, and prepare ourselves for whatever might come next.</p>
